# IncantatioPHP

Somebody told me that coding is like magic, you create something out of nothing. So even as an apprentice, I still feel like I'm casting a spell whenever something I write shows up on the screen. With this spirit kept in mind, I decide to build something just for fun and for research purpose (of course, I'm an apprentice), and that's the main reason why IncantatioPHP exists.

## Incantatio Spirit

The whole concept of IncantatioPHP is based on my imagination about a magical world (*cough! cough! Harry Potter*). So many concepts are based on the general concepts in programming world but most of the time, I'll try to find a new concept for a feature. Therefore, many things that you usually see in a typical OOP-MVC framework won't exist here. However, I promise that the concept would be the equivalent, because I'm new to this thing - writing consistent and reusable PHP code, so it's impossible for me to drive far away from the basic.

Furthermore, I'm a apprentice (that means beginner in this magical world, but we wizard don't use beginner, we use *apprentice*). So my code might be full of *curses*, very amateur and lack of standard. I'll try my best (*talking to myself again because nobody's here anyway*).

## Incantatio Core Concept

We all agree from the first place that, writing code is like casting spells or doing magic, don't we? Keep that in mind, now every complete piece of code you write equally means you are casting a spell, or, performing an incantation. There are many ways to perform an incantation, you could do it the raw way (that main *ancient* and *great* sorcerers have done).

Now, IncantatioPHP is born, in order to create a sets of structure, prebuilt incatations that help you perform an incantation easier, which finally helps you build something faster (I hope so). So, the whole core concept of IncantatioPHP is based on this thing. Based on IncantatioPHP, which provides many incantations, magical artifacts, magical ***creatures*** to help you along the way, you will then finally achieve your goal.

## Incantatio Credit
- I'm hugely inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter, so many concepts would seem familiar with a Potterhead (if you are one).
- The term `incantatio` is a Latin word. However, when I was trying to find a name, I did ask ChatGPT and it suggested me something such as "Enchanter", "Incantation" or "Arcane". I picked the `incantation` and translated it on Google Translate, so this name is partly credited to ChatGPT (please don't charge me if somehow I get famous by this framework, OpenAI).
- During the process of writing this framework, I'll do a lot of research on Google and LLM (*ChatGPT... yeah*), so I think I should give credit to these two (*who gives credit to Google for using its search engine anyway?!*). But I promise (to myself and all the sorcerers, wizards out there) that I will not use this kind of dark magic to complete this project.
