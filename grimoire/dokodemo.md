# Dokodemo - The Path to Anywhere

A request comes and a request goes. It needs to find a way to somewhere, how to do it? Dokodemo is the ultimate item for it to find the path. Dokodemo is a pink door that can take you to anywhere, as long as you provide the needed information and just open the door then enter, BOOM, you're in Japan.

## Credit

Dokodemo is a homage to my childhood, Doraemon, a Japanese manga. Dokodemo (or Dokodemo door) is a Japanese word for Anywhere Door. It's a pink door that lets you go anywhere!
