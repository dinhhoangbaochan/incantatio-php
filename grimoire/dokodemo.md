# Dokodemo - The Path to Anywhere

A request comes and a request goes. It needs to find a way to somewhere, how to do it? Dokodemo is the ultimate item for it to find the path. Dokodemo is a pink door that can take you to anywhere, as long as you provide the needed information and just open the door then enter, BOOM, you're in Japan.

## What it can do

### Carve

To go anywhere, you need to use Dokodemo, that - you already know. It's true that Dokodemo can take you to anywhere, but in order to do that, Dokodemo needs to first carve the paths first. When you use Dokodemo to carve the paths, later on when users visit a path that is already carved by Dokodemo, then Dokodemo can navigate your users to the right place, give them the right result as expected.

#### Usage

Inside any file of yours, call the `Dokodemo` door by simply:

```php
use Nexus\Dokodemo;
```

And to carve the path, do:

```php
Dokodemo:carve( $path, $action );
```

## Credit

Dokodemo is a homage to my childhood, Doraemon, a Japanese manga. Dokodemo (or Dokodemo door) is a Japanese word for Anywhere Door. It's a pink door that lets you go anywhere!
